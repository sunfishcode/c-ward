c-ward is an implementation of the libc ABI written in Rust.

It consists of two crates:
 - [c-scape], which is `no_std`, and
 - [c-gull], which pulls in c-scape and additionally provides features
   using `std`.

It is a goal of c-ward to be a C ABI layer on top of Rust-idomatic libraries,
rather than to have significant implementation code of its own.

In theory c-ward could be extended to be ABI-compatible with different
platforms, however currently it is only known to be ABI-compatible with
\*-unknown-linux-gnu\* platforms.

## Similar crates

Another libc implementation is [relibc].

## Where's the `#![no_builtins]`?

Normally, a libc implementation would use `#[no_builtins]` to prevent compilers
from noticing the bodies of libc functions implement the semantics of libc
functions and replacing them with calls, which effectively makes them uselessly
recursive calls to themselves.

However, `#[no_builtins]` is too pessimistic, because we don't need to disable
all pattern matching, just these specific cases. And, `#[no_builtins]`
[interferes with LTO optimization].

So instead, c-scape and c-gull are just careful to avoid open-coding functions
which are known to get pattern-matched into builtins, by just calling the
`compiler_builtins` implementations directly themselves. This way, we can avoid
using `#![no_builtins]`.
