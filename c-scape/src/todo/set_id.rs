//! Linux's system calls for these functions only set the IDs for one thread,
//! and we need to set the IDs for all threads in a process.
//!
//! This would typically entail taking a lock that prevents thread creation,
//! setting the IDs for each thread manually by sending signals to them and
//! having signal handlers that perform the set operation, waitinig for all
//! the handlers to run, and then releasing the lock.
